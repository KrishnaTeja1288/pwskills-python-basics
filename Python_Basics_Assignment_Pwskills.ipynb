              "'\\n\\nIn , mutable and immutable objects refer to whether the state (i.e., value) of an object can be changed after it is created. Here\\'s a comparison of mutable and immutable objects, along with examples to illustrate their differences.\\n\\n Mutable Objects\\n- Definition: Mutable objects are those whose values or state can be modified after creation.\\n- Examples: Lists, dictionaries, sets, and some user-defined classes.\\n\\n# Characteristics:\\n1. Changeable: You can alter the content of mutable objects (add, remove, or change elements) without creating a new object.\\n2. Memory Efficiency: Since changes can happen in-place, modifying mutable objects doesn\\'t necessarily create new objects, saving memory in some cases.\\n3. Methods: Mutable objects provide methods that allow modifications (e.g., `append()`, `remove()` for lists, `update()` for dictionaries).\\n   \\n# Example (List - a mutable object):\\n\\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3]\\nprint(f\"Original list: {my_list}\")\\n\\nmy_list[1] = 20  # Modify the list\\nprint(f\"Modified list: {my_list}\")\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nOriginal list: [1, 2, 3]\\nModified list: [1, 20, 3]\\n\\nHere, the value at index 1 was changed from `2` to `20` without creating a new list.\\n\\n# Another Example (Dictionary - a mutable object):\\n\\nmy_dict = {\\'name\\': \\'Alice\\', \\'age\\': 25}\\nprint(f\"Original dictionary: {my_dict}\")\\n\\nmy_dict[\\'age\\'] = 26  # Modify the dictionary\\nprint(f\"Modified dictionary: {my_dict}\")\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nOriginal dictionary: {\\'name\\': \\'Alice\\', \\'age\\': 25}\\nModified dictionary: {\\'name\\': \\'Alice\\', \\'age\\': 26}\\n\\nHere, the value associated with the key `\\'age\\'` was changed from `25` to `26`.\\n\\n Immutable Objects\\n- Definition: Immutable objects are those whose values cannot be changed after they are created. Any attempt to modify an immutable object will result in the creation of a new object.\\n- Examples: Integers, floats, strings, tuples, and frozensets.\\n\\n# Characteristics:\\n1. Unchangeable: Once created, you cannot change the value or state of immutable objects. Any change will result in a new object being created.\\n2. Memory Usage: Every modification creates a new object, which may increase memory usage if not handled properly.\\n3. Hashable: Immutable objects can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements of sets, whereas mutable objects cannot (since their value could change, leading to inconsistencies).\\n\\n# Example (String - an immutable object):\\n\\nmy_string = \"hello\"\\nprint(f\"Original string: {my_string}\")\\n\\nmy_string = my_string + \" world\"  # Concatenation creates a new string\\nprint(f\"Modified string: {my_string}\")\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nOriginal string: hello\\nModified string: hello world\\n\\nHere, `my_string` was modified, but instead of changing the original string, a new string `\"hello world\"` was created.\\n\\n# Another Example (Tuple - an immutable object):\\n\\nmy_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\\nprint(f\"Original tuple: {my_tuple}\")\\n\\n# Attempting to modify the tuple will raise an error\\n# my_tuple[0] = 10  # Uncommenting this will cause an error\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nOriginal tuple: (1, 2, 3)\\n\\nTuples cannot be modified, and attempting to do so will result in an error.\\n\\n Key Differences Between Mutable and Immutable Objects\\n\\n| Aspect                 | Mutable Objects                     | Immutable Objects                   |\\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\\n| Modifiability       | Can be modified after creation       | Cannot be modified after creation   |\\n| Examples            | List, dictionary, set               | String, tuple, integer, float       |\\n| Memory Behavior     | Changes happen in place, saving memory | New objects are created for changes |\\n| Hashable            | Not hashable (can’t be used as dictionary keys) | Hashable (can be used as keys) |\\n| Use Cases           | Useful when frequent modifications are needed | Useful when the object should remain constant |\\n\\n Example of Mutable vs. Immutable Behavior in Functions:\\n\\n# Mutable (List):\\n\\ndef modify_list(my_list):\\n    my_list.append(4)\\n\\nlst = [1, 2, 3]\\nmodify_list(lst)\\nprint(f\"List after modification: {lst}\")\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nList after modification: [1, 2, 3, 4]\\n\\nThe list is modified inside the function, and the change is reflected outside because lists are mutable.\\n\\n# Immutable (Integer):\\n\\ndef modify_number(num):\\n    num = num + 1\\n\\nnumber = 5\\nmodify_number(number)\\nprint(f\"Number after modification: {number}\")\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nNumber after modification: 5\\n\\nThe integer remains unchanged because integers are immutable, and modifying it inside the function results in a new object.\\n\\n'"
